📦 Dynamic Object Detection System

This project showcases a real-time object detection system that combines Google's Teachable Machine with OpenCV. By focusing on motion-based regions, it efficiently identifies and labels moving objects in live video feeds.
🔍 Features

    Motion Detection: Utilizes frame differencing to detect movement and define Regions of Interest (ROIs).

    Image Classification: Employs a Keras model from Teachable Machine to classify detected objects.

    Real-Time Performance: Achieves 10–15 FPS on standard CPUs.

    High Accuracy: Maintains over 90% detection accuracy with minimal false positives.

    Resource Efficient: Operates with low CPU and memory usage, suitable for devices like Raspberry Pi.
